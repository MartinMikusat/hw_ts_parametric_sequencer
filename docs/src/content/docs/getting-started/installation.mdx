## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- TypeScript >= 5.0.0 (for TypeScript projects)

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install hw-ts-parametric-sequencer
```

Or via yarn:

```bash
yarn add hw-ts-parametric-sequencer
```

Or via pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add hw-ts-parametric-sequencer
```

## TypeScript Support

The library is written in TypeScript and includes full type definitions. No additional `@types` package is needed.

## Tree-Shaking

The library is designed for optimal tree-shaking:

- Importing only from `/2d` will exclude all 3D code from your bundle
- Importing only from `/3d` will exclude all 2D code from your bundle
- No shared code between 2D and 3D implementations ensures complete separation

## Framework Integration

This library is framework-agnostic. It only provides animation state data. You need to integrate it with your chosen rendering framework:

- **Three.js**: Update Object3D positions, rotations, and materials
- **React Three Fiber**: Use state in your component render functions
- **Canvas 2D**: Draw sprites based on animation state
- **SVG**: Update SVG element transforms
- **Any other framework**: Use the animation state to update your scene

See the [Examples](/guides/examples/) section for framework-specific integration examples.
